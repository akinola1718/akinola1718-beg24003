## 👋 Hi, I'm **Oluwaseun Akinola (Moses)**

## About Me
I’m Moses, a second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Environmental Engineering at the University of Connecticut. My research focuses on computational air-quality and atmospheric chemistry modeling, with particular interest in ozone formation, VOC/NOx sensitivity, and temperature-driven urban impacts using tools like CMAQ, WRF, F0AM, and GIS. Before starting my Ph.D., I gained seven years of professional experience across the public health, energy, and environmental consulting sectors. Beyond research, I currently serve as the Parliamentarian of the John Lof Leadership Academy at UConn and as a research fellow in the National Science Foundation Research Traineeship program (UConn chapter).
I’m currently learning advanced GIS and spatial analysis techniques, improving my machine-learning skills for environmental applications, and refining high-performance computing workflows for large-scale atmospheric simulations. I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to air quality, climate change, urban environments, and environmental risk mapping—especially where ML, GIS, and open-source modeling tools intersect.

💬 Ask me about ozone chemistry, isopleths, F0AM/CMAQ/WRF workflows, GIS for environmental analysis, or navigating PhD research and interdisciplinary science.

⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy breaking down complex environmental systems into models—and then breaking the models to understand them better.
Here are some ideas to get you started:
